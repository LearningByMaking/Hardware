Hello potential App Board Assember,

In this document you should find:

2 PDF schematics documentating which SMD parts go where
1 parts list outlining all the parts used on the board
1 folder of images of the board both populated and unpopulated

Hopefully this is everything you need to construct an accurate bid/budget for the project. While the project focuses mainly on the surface mount components, please also include the soldering of all header pins in your estimate as well as the costs of properly packaging and shipping the completed boards back to Sonoma State. 

If you have any further technical questions, please do not hestitate to contact me directly:

If you have any financial or administrative questions, please direct them to the sender of this email.

Thanks for your interest in the project, 
-Kevin
